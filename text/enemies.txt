I'm not a bug.
Just a really complicated feature.
Why are you looking at me like that?

while True:

Yes there's a newer version of the
library I'm from, why do you ask?

Oh. You found me.
Listen, it's not what you think --
I'm here to make the program more fun!
Will it crash or not this time?
No way to tell! So exciting!
What's life without a bit of adventure?

Hello, my name's ValueError,
and you are?

If you haven't caused a CVE yet
you haven't really lived.

Hey there programmer! What's up?
What do you mean, am I a bug?
That's kinda rude.

I've been here since the very beginning!
I'm obviously a feature!
I'm also part of the public API lol
There's at least 3 people explicitly
    depending on me by now.
