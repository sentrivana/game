Hey there programmer! What's up?
What do you mean, am I a bug?
That's kinda rude.

Oh. You found me.
Listen, it's not what you think --
I'm here to make the program more fun!
Will it crash or not this time?
No way to tell! So exciting!
What's life without a bit of adventure?

I'm not a bug.
Just a really complicated feature.

I've been here since the very beginning!
I'm obviously a feature!
I'm also part of the public API lol
There's at least 3 people explicitly
    depending on me by now.
