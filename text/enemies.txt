Hey there programmer! What's up?
What do you mean, am I a bug?
That's kinda rude.

If you haven't caused a CVE yet
have you really lived?

while True:

Yes there's a newer version of the
library I'm from, why do you ask?

Hello, my name's ValueError,
and you are?

You wouldn't dare
There's at least 3 people explicitly
depending on me existing by now

Oh. You found me.
Listen, it's not what you think --
I'm here to make the program more fun!
Will it crash or not this time?
No way to tell! So exciting!
What's life without a bit of adventure?
